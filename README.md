# What is Test Case?
A test case in manual testing is a set of steps and expected outcomes that are used to evaluate the functionality of a software application. The goal of a test case is to determine whether the software behaves as intended and meets the requirements for a specific feature or functionality. Test cases are usually written by manual testers and are executed manually, without the use of automated tools.
